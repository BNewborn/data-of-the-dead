###Data of the Dead (and co.)

I created this code last fall - it was good practice with Selenium and wrangling otherwise messy data into a relational and useful format. And, I got a chance to play around with data about something I care about - great music from the Grateful Dead.

This project has 3 primary notebooks

1) Phantasytour_scrape - this is where I scraped (phantasytour)[https://www.phantasytour.com/bands/dead/setlists] for recent Dead and Company show info and setlists.

2) Unfolding_dataframe - I had to turn this scraped data into a useful dataframe-esque format. This notebook shows those efforts

3) dead_eda - here is where I started to visualize and review the now-clean data

I hope you enjoy!
